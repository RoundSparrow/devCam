/* DesignResult class, which complements a CaptureDesign object. The DesignResult contains all of
 * the relevant information about the outputs of the capturing process of a CaptureDesign.
 * This includes, for each frame of the sequence:
 * - the timestamp of when the frame started capture. Used as a unique ID to indicate an image belonging to the sequence.
 * - the Image that was captured.
 * - the CaptureResult metadata associated with the frame
 * - the filename that this frame is to be written out to
 *
 * This information about each frame is captured as soon as it is available. In general, the
 * timestamp will come in first, since that is available as soon as the exposure starts integrating,
 * and obviously the CaptureResult and Image are not available until it is done. However, depending
 * on the device and the requested image format, the order in which these latter two pieces is
 * available is uncertain.
 *
 * To get around this, whenever a new CaptureResult or Image is available, it is stored in the
 * DesignResult. The DesignResult then checks to see if it has already registered the corresponding
 * element, based on unique timestamp ID.
 *
 * Once both elements are available and registered, the DesignResult generates a filename for the
 * frame capture and sends all three pieces back to the main activity thread for whatever action it
 * wants to take- generally writing out of the image via an ImageSaver object.
